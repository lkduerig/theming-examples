These are the theme files that were / are used in tieto.com. I do not anymore enjoy looking at this code, as I've learned a lot since then, but I have included it because: After moving off of the tieto.com project, I find it interesting how often I accidentally discover some other project that has borrowed my SASS structure as a template. This is a very immature version of my favorite SASS/SMACSS setup, but it is the one I see most often copied.
